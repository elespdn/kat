Collation of the text of the three autograph manuscrits where Boccaccio copied Dante's Commedia.

Collation_1
Collation on the semi-diplomatic transcription. Regularize spelling: 'í' to 'i'.
Collation is performed with segmentation=False, for easiness of comparison with the following results.

Collation_2
Same as Collation_1, adding parameter: near_match=True.

Collation_3
Spelling is normalized using forms in dictionary.csv, created manually, and collation performed on normalized forms.
The output is rendered both in a table and as a graph.

Collation_4
Lemmas and POS influence the alignment. Lemmas and POS are defined automatically using TreeTagger with the parameter file for Dante's texts made available by Angelo (Fondazione Bruno Kessler).
